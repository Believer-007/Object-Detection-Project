Car Number Plate Detection with YOLOv8
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a car number plate detection model using the YOLOv8 architecture. The model is trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle and subsequently deployed on a Streamlit web application for real-time inference.

Key Components
YOLOv8: A state-of-the-art object detection architecture known for its speed and accuracy.
Dataset: A collection of images containing car number plates, obtained from Kaggle.
Training: The process of fine-tuning the YOLOv8 model on the dataset to recognize and localize car number plates.
Streamlit: A Python framework used to create interactive web applications for deploying the trained model.
Installation and Usage
